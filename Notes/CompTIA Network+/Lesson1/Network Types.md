Computer Network is a system that allows network devices such as computers, phones, tablets, and much more to interact with each other. Based on the scale of the network it can be connected through the internet, share files, communicate, print documents. A network can be private or available in a specific geographical area.

Computer network is usually divided by the size of the Network, below are the summaries of network types and its definition
- **Local Area Network (LAN)**, allows users to connect within a short distance in a common area.
- **Personal Area Network**, small scale network revolves around one person or device.
- **Wireless Area Network**, it is really similar to LAN however the network is exclusively using wireless connection.
- **Campus Area Network**, specific type of network that is used in education environments, lets say multiple departments in a uni has their own LAN, and they are each connected by CAN.
- **Metropolitan Area Network**, larger size than CAN and is dedicated across a city or the entire metropolitan area.
- **Wide Area Network**, extensive network that's not confined to a geographical space. Usually the network is connected via the Internet.
- **Storage Area Network (SAN)**, specific type of network that companies use to store mass amounts of sensitive data.

There are a lot more types of network and the difference is just in the specific use case each network is dedicated for.
